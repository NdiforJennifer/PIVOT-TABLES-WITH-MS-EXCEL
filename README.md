Pivot Tables

I explored pivot tables using data on global bike store sales that I downloaded from Kaggle. I created a pivot table that includes a count of 2034666 data. In this pivot table, I calculated the sum of costs, sum of revenue, and sum of profit for Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

Additionally, I made effective use of calculated fields. I also created another pivot table to calculate the total revenue for the years 2011 to 2016 for Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States. A screenshot of the pivot tables is included below.
